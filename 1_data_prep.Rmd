# Data preparation

## Read data from Excel files

Data from mothers and fathers from the greenhouse data file

```{r}
data_mothers_fathers<-read_excel("C:/Users/alici/Dropbox/SU/Projects/cerastium_greenhouse/data/edited/Cerastium_greenhouse_spring_2022_editedAV.xlsx", 
                       sheet="extracted_data_mothers_fathers")
```

Phenology data from transplants

```{r}
data_phen_transplants<-read_excel("data/edited/Hengill_2022_Final.02_AV.xlsx", 
                       sheet="extracted_data_phen")
```

# IDs for matching with data from transplants

The numbers for mothers and fathers of the transplanted plants match mother and father in the greenhouse data when the plant came from a cross-pollination. When the plant came from a self-pollination, the number for the mother (=father) is the original seed mother ID (mother_originalID_iceland) without the plot number (numeric_code).

For example, for mother_originalID_iceland = H05 422:3/2, if this plant was selfed, the mother id would be 422.

There is also a "M3" mother - where does this come from? Is it M3 in Group 1 = H04 409:3/3? I suppose so by now.

Extract the numeric_code from mother_originalID_iceland

```{r}
data_mothers_fathers<-data_mothers_fathers%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric=substr(sub(".* ", "",original_id_Iceland),1,3))
```

```{r}
unique(data_mothers_fathers$original_id_numeric)
```

Fix some that are not correct

```{r}
data_mothers_fathers<-data_mothers_fathers%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="HC2","871",original_id_numeric))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="24/","24",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="7:3","7",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="63:","63",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="48:","48",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="1:1","1",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="1:3","1",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="53:","53",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="99:","99",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="92:","92",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="110","1100",original_id_numeric_fixed))%>%
  mutate(original_id_numeric_fixed=ifelse(original_id_numeric=="114","1149",original_id_numeric_fixed))
```

Create new tibble with ids and temp

```{r}
data_temp_parents<-data_mothers_fathers%>%
  select(original_id_Iceland,new_id_malin,original_id_numeric_fixed,temp)
```

This tibble will be used to merge with transplant data, in order to get to know the temperature of the parents.
Merge based on new_id_malin for the crosspollinated plants, and on original_id_numeric_fixed for the selfpollinated plants.

# Phenology data prep

## Change mother noted as "M3"

There is one mother noted as M3. This should be M3 in group 1 = H04 409:3/3.
So I change this mother to 409.

```{r}
data_phen_transplants<-data_phen_transplants%>%
  mutate(mother=ifelse(mother=="M3",409,mother))
```

## Change column types

```{r}
data_phen_transplants<-data_phen_transplants%>%
  mutate_at(c("heat_zone","group","mother","father","id","repl","plot",
              "peak","fruit_coll","poll_type"),as.factor)%>%
  mutate_at(c("y","temp1","temp2","temp3"),as.numeric)%>%
  mutate_at(c("n_shoots"),as.integer)
```

## Create unique ids

```{r}
data_phen_transplants<-data_phen_transplants%>%
  mutate(unique_id=paste(heat_zone,id,repl,sep="_")) 
```

## Correct one error in stage

```{r}
data_phen_transplants<-data_phen_transplants%>%
  mutate(stage2=ifelse(unique_id=="Hot_138_a"&stage2=="B3","W",stage2))
```

## Calculate temperature

Use temp1 and temp3. There are 509 cases where both temps are available:

```{r}
nrow(data_phen_transplants%>%filter(!is.na(temp1)&!is.na(temp3)))
```

Regression of temp3 on temp1 (and viceversa) using these 509 cases:

```{r}
model_temp3<-lm(temp3~temp1,
           data_phen_transplants%>%filter(!is.na(temp1)&!is.na(temp3)))
summary(model_temp3)
model_temp1<-lm(temp1~temp3,
           data_phen_transplants%>%filter(!is.na(temp1)&!is.na(temp3)))
summary(model_temp1)
data_phen_transplants%>%filter(!is.na(temp1)&!is.na(temp3))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=temp1,y=temp3))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")
data_phen_transplants%>%filter(!is.na(temp1)&!is.na(temp3))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=temp3,y=temp1))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

Use this regression to impute missing values of temp1 and temp3:

```{r}
# Create new columns for imputed values
data_phen_transplants$temp1_imp <- data_phen_transplants$temp1
data_phen_transplants$temp3_imp <- data_phen_transplants$temp3

# Identify rows with missing values in temp1
missing_temp1_rows <- is.na(data_phen_transplants$temp1)

# Predict temp1 values using the regression model and update temp1_imp
data_phen_transplants$temp1_imp[missing_temp1_rows] <-
  predict(model_temp1, newdata = data_phen_transplants[missing_temp1_rows, ])

# Identify rows with missing values in temp3
missing_temp3_rows <- is.na(data_phen_transplants$temp3)

# Predict temp3 values using the regression model and update temp3_imp
data_phen_transplants$temp3_imp[missing_temp3_rows] <- 
  predict(model_temp3, newdata = data_phen_transplants[missing_temp3_rows, ])

# Now, data_phen_transplants$temp1_imp and data_phen_transplants$temp3_imp 
# have imputed values while preserving original values
```

Calculate temperature as the mean of temp1_imp and temp3_imp. this was done in 852 out of 858 cases where these both temp1_imp and temp3_imp are available. Of the 6 remaining cases, 4 have all three temperature values missing, and in 2 only temp 2 is available. 

```{r}
data_phen_transplants<-data_phen_transplants%>%
  mutate(temp=(temp1_imp+temp3_imp)/2)
```

## Convert to long format and divide stage into real stage + grazing

"stage" column contains info on stage:

- V (Vegetative)	Only vegetative growth
- B1 (Bud stage 1)	Buds are just starting to form, very small
- B2 (Bud stage 2)	Buds are at medium size 
- B3 (Bud stage 3)	Buds are large but still completely closed
- B4 (Bud stage 4)	Buds are large and almost starting to flower
- F (Flowering)	At least one flower has opened
- F100 (100% flowering)	All flowers have opened, none are yet wilted
- W (Wilted)	At least one flower has wilted
- W100 (100% wilted)	All flowers are wilted

But also on grazing / lost and dead plants:

- X (Lost)	Neither plant nor nail was not found that day
- D (Dead)	Plant still in place but dead
- G (Grazed/gone)	Nail was found but no sign of plant
- SG (All stems grazed/gone)	All stems grazed/gone but with visible stubs
- /SG (Stem(s) grazed/gone from plant)	One or more stems have been grazed but there are still some left, phenology is measured for the one that is most mature
- A (Aborted)	All flowerbuds have stopped development, none have nor will open

Separate info from "stage" column into "stage" and "graz" columns. 

Remove plants that did not flower (where there is no record with stages F or F100 or W or W100). 

```{r}
data_phen_transplants_long<-full_join(
  data_phen_transplants%>%
    pivot_longer(cols=starts_with("week"),names_to="revision",

    select(unique_id,plot,revision,stage))%>%
  separate(stage,into=c("stage","graz"),sep="/")

nrow(data_phen_transplants_long%>%distinct(unique_id)) # 858 ids


data_phen_transplants_long$graz <- with(data_phen_transplants_long,
                          ifelse(stage %in% c("X","G","D","SG","A"),
                            stage,graz)) # Info that should be on "graz" column

                          ifelse(stage %in% c("X","G","D","SG","A"),
                            NA,stage))

unique(data_phen_transplants_long$graz) # Correct
unique(data_phen_transplants_long$stage) # Correct

ids_fl <- filter(data_phen_transplants_long, 
                 stage %in% c("F","F100","W","W100"))%>%
  distinct(unique_id) 
nrow(ids_fl) # 603 ids that flowered
  
data_phen_transplants_long <- data_phen_transplants_long %>%
  filter(unique_id %in% as.vector(ids_fl$unique_id))

length(unique(data_phen_transplants_long$unique_id)) 
# Now including only the 603 ids that flowered
```

## Create column for vegetative / flowering / wilted

```{r}
data_phen_transplants_long <- data_phen_transplants_long %>%
  mutate(V_F=ifelse(stage %in% c("V","B1","B2","B3","B4"),"V",
                    ifelse(stage %in% c("F","F100","W","W100"),"F",NA)))%>%
  mutate(V_F_W=ifelse(stage %in% c("V","B1","B2","B3","B4"),"V",
                    ifelse(stage %in% c("F","F100"),"F",
                           ifelse(stage %in% c("W","W100"),"W",NA))))
```

## Calculate FFD and LFD (mean and corrected)

FFD: Get date for last recording with buds and first recording with flowers. Calculate FFD_meanDOY as the mean date between last recording with buds and first recording with flowers.
